    <p>Welcome to Columbia University Libraries journals! Through our journals program the Libraries and our Digital Scholarship team support the creation, discovery, and dissemination of quality open-access research.</p>
    <p>We seek collaborations with Columbia-affiliated faculty and students who want to ask new questions, play at the borders of currently canonized fields, open new pathways of inquiry, explore innovative methods, and bring new and traditionally underrepresented voices into conversation.</p>
